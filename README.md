# libipceng
Library for Linux Inter-Process Communication (IPC): simultaneous; asynchronous; based on posix message queue and Linux 
kernel doubly linked-list.

simultaneous: two processes can send data to each other at the same time\
asynchronous: there is no need to synchronous send-receive communication models

This is actually just a more beautiful wrapper around posix message queue and probably simpler!
